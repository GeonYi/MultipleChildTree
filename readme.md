## **Multi Child Tree**


it's implement just tree struct.

tree is set of node.  *tree* consists of *parent*, *child*.

root has just 2 child in java(as BinaryTree API).  so, i implement tree will have many child.

in java,
~~~
  root  -> Child01 -> child011
                   -> child012
        -> Child02 -> child021
                   -> child022
~~~

child01 is parent node of child011, child012 and child of root.

it's impossible has many child. like this,

~~~
  root  -> Child01 -> child011
                   -> child012
                   -> child013
        -> Child02 -> child021
                   -> child022
~~~

And, i wanted each node are runnable.  but, doesn't impl, just declare interface.

if using this code and need running of node, than send mail. Or need more function, also send mail.
